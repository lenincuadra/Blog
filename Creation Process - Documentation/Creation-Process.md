   - This one was an important to understand on if is necesary now or if I need it to skip it. FEELS FOUNDATIONS TO ME for ANY frontend after this research, so let's go.
   - Designed a Logo for myself, I took my own Sign as a logo, built it in Canva with ~7 minutes with my trackpad, replace the background color to added to the header and is done! Graffiti skills cames to the Rescue of my time (![How I built my Logo in 7min](../assets/LENK-logo__How-I-Built-it.png))

- [Learn Sass In 20 Minutes | Sass Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz6eOVaaelI)
- - This is kinda better, I could go back to this one, is kinda hard to apply stuff just from videos like this one that doesn't have a good project to teach you, but it works a lot. (DONE)
- [SASS Tutorial (build your own CSS library) #2 - Compiling SASS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk5jMurFHCo&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jxJX7vojNVK-o8ubDZEcNb&index=2)

6. Day 4. date_Nov-26-Tue-2024 - Yes, I jump course to course to learn what I want. This dude made some videos before on design that helps me a lot, I'm thrilled now, is pretty old but has a good pace to learn, I'm good with this.
